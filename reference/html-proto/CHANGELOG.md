# Magiclike (html-proto) — Changelog

Version history for the html-proto rules engine, newest entries appended on each version bump. (Moved out of `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-06-02 to keep that doc navigable; see `CLAUDE.md` for the current `VERSION`, the module map, and structure.)

**Current: `v2.0.84`** (source of truth: `js/main.js` `const VERSION` — keep this line in sync on bump). v2.0.0 was the
Slice 3 effects/targeting refactor (atomic-effect collapse, unified `target()`
step with restriction `target_filter`, `move_card`, mana-as-ability, sticker
pipeline, splice harmonization). v2.0.1: post-refactor bug-fix sweep — boss
special-removal + mind-control AI casting, the trigger/cast/highlight
target-prompt regressions, the drain→life-loss migration, and card-text polish.
v2.0.2: consolidated the targeting-shape question into one engine API
(`objectNeedsTarget`/`primaryLegalTargets`/`probeTargetsForObject`) that the cast
flow, castable highlight, and trigger prompt all route through. v2.0.3: decoupled
authored text from the `special` gameplay flag (now keyed on `customText` only),
so 5 cards (vileEdict, symmetricize, endomorph, bleach, embargo) generate
accurate text from their effects instead of hand-written text that can drift.
v2.0.4: completed the card-data-Part-2 dispatch-key snake_case sweep for effect
kinds (card.json + JS `EFFECTS` table). Supersedes STANDARDIZATION-PLAN §4.6's
"JS stays camelCase" for dispatch keys. v2.0.5: finished the sweep — keywords
(`first_strike`, `double_strike`) and target filters (`permanent_or_spell`,
`graveyard_creature`); events + predicate ids were already snake (Slice 2). All
four Godot `JsonCardLoader` remap tables are now dead, slated for deletion.
v2.0.6: split the overloaded `player` target into `opp` (opponent-only — drain/
burn/discard/edict) vs `player` (free choice — heals), so generated text matches
the actual legal targets instead of guessing "opponent" from the effect kind.
v2.0.7: filter parity — the engine now enforces every restriction the card text
renders (`minTough`/`maxPower`/`minPower`/`notKeyword` added to matchFilter) and
the text renders every restriction the engine enforces (`notToken`); fixed
counterSpecialist's preamble ("cast a counterspell", not "counter a spell").
v2.0.8: fixed the UI player-target button for "any target" spells — `getValidTargets`
now accepts the §3.5 taxonomy spelling `creature_or_player` (was legacy `any` only),
and render drives the "→ Target <player>" button off real legality instead of a
hardcoded target list (so `opp` correctly shows only the opponent's face).
v2.0.9: unified the "creature or player" target token on the single canonical
spelling `creature_or_player` (matches Godot's taxonomy + the docs). Migrated the
last per-effect `target:'any'` holdouts (crusadersCharm/stormCharm modal modes +
trigger-generator's damageAny roll) and dropped the v2.0.8 `any` alias — `any` is
no longer a target token anywhere in proto, so the Godot loader's
`_TARGET_FILTER_REMAP["any"]` can finally die. (`choose:'any'` for mana color is a
separate field and stays.)
v2.0.10: City of Brass mana label `W`→`C` — it's an identity-less land (taps for
any color via the §3.9 `add_mana choose:'any'` ability, but has no color identity),
so it now renders a colorless frame and stops counting as a White source in
deck-color/draft-pip display. `C` is the colorless-identity land label; the
land-mana invariant test exempts it (production stays WUBRG).
v2.0.11: post-refactor review cleanup (slice 1/4). Unified mass `grant_keyword` onto
the `scope` field (`all_yours`/`all_creatures`) — retired the parallel `whose`
(`allYours`/`all`) field, which was a half-migrated distributed invariant (every mass
consumer read both) AND the lone camelCase wire-value violation. Deleted two dead
branches (legacy `condition`-as-function + `params.sub` fallback in triggers.js) and
fixed stale comments/docs (zone-change migration-window comment, CLAUDE.md trigger
registry name, PROTOCOL exile_until_eot row).
v2.0.12: review cleanup (slice 2/4) — finished the spec'd `remove_creature`→
`affect_creature` rename (plan §6.7/decision 12) across the EFFECTS dispatch, all
31 cards, and every consumer, AND converted `severity` from integers `1-4` to the
string ladder `tap|bounce|destroy|exile` (plan §5). Centralized the int↔string
mapping in one helper (`sevToNum`/`numToSev`); empower still promotes severity up
the ladder. Resolves the half-wired `affect_creature` phantom the review flagged
(name was referenced in schema/valuation but undispatchable).
v2.0.13: fixed two AI severity-scoring sites the v2.0.12 rename missed — they read
`eff.severity` with numeric comparisons (`sev === 3`), silently mis-scoring string
severities (a `destroy` spell scored as `exile`; a `tap` ignored its already-tapped
guard). No crash, so tests/selfplay stayed green — the textbook §8.1 lockstep trap.
Both now go through `_sevNum`; added a regression (AI won't `tap` an already-tapped
creature).
v2.0.14: review cleanup (slice 3/4) — decomposed Scarification (plan #18): the
`destroy_and_sticker_slot` monolith → `[apply_sticker(scarified), affect_creature(
destroy)]` (sticker-FIRST so the run-slot scar lands before the creature leaves;
matches embargo's pattern). Extended `apply_sticker` to accept a registry
`stickerId` (not just an inline descriptor) for complex registered stickers.
Deleted the `destroy_and_sticker_slot` handler + all its classification/scoring/
text sites. Behavior note: under atomic decomposition an indestructible target now
gets scarred-but-not-destroyed (the monolith fizzled both halves) — an acceptable
edge on a boss-targeted creature.

v2.0.43–44: fixed Bleach's inert "bleaching." Bleach is `[apply_sticker
set_color C, move_card exile]` — Swords/Path-rate exile removal whose UPSIDE is
the bleach: the exiled creature's mana cost becomes permanently colorless, so
(cast on your own creature) it returns color-flexible for the rest of the run.
The bug: `set_color` only changed the frame color, not the COST, and color is
read by almost nothing (only Doom Blade's `not_color` filter) — so the signature
effect did nothing. Fix: `set_color C` now also folds the target's colored cost
pips into generic `{C}` (e.g. `{W}{B}{B}` → `{3}`), updating the runtime card AND
the persisted run-slot (the "Forever") — verified a rebuilt-from-slot card comes
back colorless. Added card-text for the `set_color` rider ("…it becomes
colorless, including its mana cost, permanently") + a standalone-`apply_sticker`
case. (v2.0.43 briefly removed the exile on a misread of intent; v2.0.44 restored
it — Bleach IS removal, the cost-bleach is the upside.) Tests updated:
test_balancer asserts exile + cost-fold + slot persistence + rebuilt-colorless.
1200 green, lint clean, 200-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.45: **unified type-system Phase 1** (design-of-record: `docs/plan-unified-type-system.md`).
Additive foundation, ZERO behavior change: new `js/types.js` derives a card's type
tags on-demand from the legacy `card.type` + `card.sub` fields and exposes the
future single source of truth — `typesOf` / `hasType` / `governingType` /
`isPermanent` / `typeLine` over a small `TYPE_REGISTRY`. Nothing in the engine
reads these yet; Phase 2 migrates the ~50 `card.type === X` / `card.sub` reads onto
them, Phase 3 authors `types[]` directly + adds the type-modifier layer (manlands,
"becomes an artifact") + retires Instant→flash-Sorcery, Phase 4 ships the first
multi-type cards (Robots, artifact lands). `governingType` resolves the two-fork
governance (permanent beats spell; Creature > Land among permanents; Artifact/
Enchantment co-types). `typeLine` is a canonical parser (supertypes + types left
of the em-dash, subtypes right, deduped). `test_types_identity.js` pins
equivalence with legacy `type`/`sub` across all 258 cards + a synthesized
multi-type case. 1221 green, lint clean, selfplay clean.

v2.0.46: **unified type-system Phase 2** — converted every rule-evaluation read of
`card.type`/`card.sub` across all modules onto the `hasType`/`governingType`/
`isPermanent`/`typeLine` accessors (~150 sites: engine ~50, ai 24, the rest
spread over render/controller/cards/draft/card-text/triggers/stickers/run). Each
conversion is behavior-preserving — every card is single-type today, so
`hasType(c,'X') === (c.type==='X')` exactly. The `Creature||Land||Artifact`
permanent-triples collapse to `isPermanent()`; subtype word-boundary regexes
collapse to `hasType(c, sub)`; the dead `PERMANENT` regex in controller.js is
gone; display/search strings route through `governingType`. **LEFT for Phase 3**
(type-representation machinery, not reads): the staple/splice synthesis
(`canonicalSplicePair`/`mergeStapleInto`, engine.js ~88–516), the `type:`/`sub:`
copy-writes, `card.legendary`, and the Instant→flash retirement. `render.js`'s
typeline now calls `typeLine(card)`: a cosmetic improvement for the 6 basic-land
cards whose legacy `sub` repeated "Land" — `forest`/etc. now render the
MTG-correct **"Basic Land"** (via a new `Basic` supertype in the registry) and
`cityOfBrass` renders **"Land"** (was "Land — Land"). Everything else renders
identically. 1222 green (+1 supertype assertion), lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.47: **unified type-system Phase 3a** — retired the `Instant` type (spec §7). An
old Instant is now a `Sorcery` with the `flash` keyword: mechanically identical
(flash → instant-speed cast), and the keyword-render guard is creature-gated so
the 42 migrated cards display as plain "Sorcery" with no "Flash" line. Data: all
42 `"type":"Instant"` card.jsons rewritten to `Sorcery` + `flash` keyword
(parse→serialize round-trip, zero formatting churn). Logic: the cast gates
(`isLegalAction` castSpell, `getLegalActions` spells) drop the `Instant` branch
and gate purely on `flash`; `Instant` removed from `TYPE_REGISTRY`; spell-value /
damaging-spell-keyword checks key on `Sorcery` alone; the AI's "instant
flexibility premium" and off-turn-castable check now key on the flash keyword.
(`isInstantWindow`/`isSorceryWindow` are timing-window names — unchanged.) The
chosen direction (user): retire to "Sorcery", not keep an Instant display label.
1223 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.48: **unified type-system Phase 3b/3c** — completes the identity refactor.
(b) **Legendary → supertype tag** (§9): `Legendary` registered as a supertype,
derived from the existing `legendary` boolean in `typesOf` (boolean stays the
authored field). The cast-time legend-rule check routes through
`hasType(card,'Legendary')` — kept as named engine code, not a registry hook, per
§4. `typeLine` renders the supertype first, so the one legendary card
(`cityGuardian`) shows the MTG-correct "Legendary Creature — Human Soldier" (legacy
render omitted it). (c) **Explicit `types[]` authoring hook** (Phase-4 readiness):
`typesOf` honors an explicit `card.types` array over the legacy type/sub
derivation, and `makeCard` carries a template's `types[]` onto the runtime
instance — so a future multi-type card (a Robot = `["Artifact","Creature"]`) works
end-to-end with no per-site changes. Subtype-fold was already complete (Phase 2:
subtypes live in `typesOf`, `card_has_subtype` → `hasType`). **Parked as
pull-by-need** (no consumer given "no new cards yet"): the `typeGrantedBy`
type-modifier layer + `add_type`/`set_types` stickers (type-CHANGE effects:
manlands, "becomes an artifact") and teaching staple synthesis to UNION same-class
types — the splice machinery (engine.js ~88–516) still reads `tpl.type`/`tpl.sub`
on authored templates, which is correct until a multi-type staple is authored.
1227 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.49: **unified type-system Phase 4** — the type-change layer + the first
multi-type cards. Pulls the parked Phase-3 capability now that cards need it.
- **Type-modifier layer** (mirrors keyword grants): `card.typeGrants =
  [{tags,op,source,eot}]`, read live by `typesOf` (a 'set' grant replaces the
  working type set, an 'add' grant unions tags in) so every hasType/governingType
  reader sees the change with no per-instance baking. New `add_type` / `set_types`
  EFFECTS handlers (via `applyTypeChange`): optional `power/toughness` animate the
  target through the EOT-clearing `tempPower/tempTou`. Reverts ride the existing
  end-of-turn cleanup (eot grants + temp stats clear together) and
  `resetInPlayState` (leave-play). Registered in valuation (UNVALUED), cast-scoring
  (NOT_TARGET_SCORED — player-castable, covered by `test_type_change`), and
  card-text (`describeEffect`).
- **21 test cards** (auto-discovered; manifest rebuilt to 279): 7 type-change
  spells (`awakenVault`/`livingLands`/`brandOfIron`/`petrify`/`encaseInAmber`/
  `golemForge`/`suddenVines` — add_type & set_types, eot & permanent, two with
  flash), 8 colorless artifact creatures (`copperGolem` etc. — `types:["Artifact",
  "Creature",<sub>]`), 6 artifact lands (WUBRG + C: `gildedSeat`/`tidalConduit`/
  `boneReliquary`/`emberAnvil`/`verdantVerge`/`drossPylon`). Cards carry `type`
  (governing) + explicit `types[]` (full set). Art is emoji placeholders.
- **Draft pool** widened: nonbasic artifact lands (Land + Artifact) are now
  draftable; basic lands still excluded.
- **QA fixes** (from the Phase-1–3 review): RISK #1 — `typesOf` now unions the
  `Legendary` supertype even on the explicit-`types[]` path (a legendary multi-type
  card was silently losing the legend rule); NIT #1 — the battlefield-sort
  `typeOrder` reads `governingType` instead of raw `.type`.
- New `test_type_change.js` (33 assertions). **Parked still**: staple same-class
  UNION (stapling a multi-type card won't yet union types — not exercised by these
  cards; the splice machinery still reads `tpl.type`/`tpl.sub`). 1261 green, lint
  clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.50: type-change card polish — auto-text + AI tooling. (1) `withFilter`
(card-text) now narrows the generic noun by a `target_filter.type`: "target
permanent" + `{type:'Land'}` → **"target land"** (the four land-animate spells
now read correctly; only they use a typed top-level filter, so nothing else
shifts). (2) `add_type`/`set_types` moved from UNVALUED/NOT_TARGET_SCORED →
VALUED/TARGET_SCORED with best-guess heuristics, since the pool is shared (no
player/AI split) and a spell with zero tooling is never cast: `spellValueForEffects`
values an animating add_type at the body it makes (else ~1) and a set_types at
11/5 (permanent/eot); `scoreSpellTargetForMode` aims set_types (neutralize) at the
opponent's best creature — permanent base 20, eot base 8, +card value +lane — and
animate-add_type only at a permanent WE control (else it'd gift the opponent a
body). Verified via `AI.decide`: the AI now casts Encase in Amber at an enemy
creature. 1269 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.84: **real pixel art for 22 cards** (emoji placeholders → `art.png`: abyss_lurker, aerial_maneuver, aether_drake, aether_voyager, ancestral_priest, awakener, beast_whisperer, beasts_fury, benevolent_angel, blood_artist, bloodthirster, bloodthirsty_stalker, cavalry_captain, cloud_caller, crusader_captain [replaced prior art], cult_priest, demonic_tutor, divine_favor, mind_rot, pit_fiend, reaper_shade, vampire_bat) + three typeline fixes (Bindspeaker → Merfolk Wizard, Bloodthirster → Vampire Bat, Illusion Drake → Illusion Drake). Data/art only; no engine change.

v2.0.83: **AI scores a buff-then-fight WITH the buff (PR #57 review fix).**
`scoreFightExchange` used base stats, so the AI passed on cleanly-favorable Predate
casts where the +1/+1 is exactly what wins the fight (repro: our 2/4 vs their 3/3 —
post-pump 3/5 kills the 3/3 and survives, but the scorer saw pre-pump 2 power → score
0 → `<=0` pass). `scoreMultiTargetSpell` now folds same-spell `pump`/`add_counter`
boosts that land on a fight combatant's slot into the exchange estimate (`statBySlot`).
Hopeless fights still pass (1/1 vs 5/5 dies even pumped); Prey Upon (no buff) unchanged.
Regression added to `test_predate_fight_d1`. 1373 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay
clean.

v2.0.82: **`fight` becomes a symmetric two-operand primitive + card-level
`target_slots` is now authoritative for enumeration (fixes a latent AI bug).** The
v2.0.81 `fight` kept an asymmetric `target_slot:1` + `fighter:{slot:0}` shape — a
workaround for the engine's one-`target_slot`-per-effect rule. Root-caused to ONE
inconsistency: the UI/probe path (`probeTargetsForObject`/`objectNeedsTarget`) reads
`card.target_slots` directly, but the AI path (`validTargetsBySlot` + `isLegalAction`
+ `getLegalActions`) derived slots from which effects carry a `target_slot`. Made all
three AI sites treat declared `card.target_slots` as authoritative (behavior-identical
for every existing multi-target card — they all claim every slot via an effect; only
modal charms, which declare no card-level slots, keep the per-effect grouping). Now a
single effect can reference multiple slots: `fight` carries
`operands:[{slot:0},{slot:1}]` (Predate / **Prey Upon**) or `[{select:'highest_power_yours'},
{slot:0}]` (the auto-pick cards), reading both combatants from `ctx.allTargets`; no
`fighter`/`target_slot`. New **Prey Upon** ({G} Sorcery, "target creature you control
fights target creature an opponent controls") — a fight-only card that was *impossible*
to author before (its fighter slot went unenumerated). **Bug fixed:** v2.0.80/81 Predate
was AI-uncastable — a targeted cast scores purely via `scoreMultiTargetSpell`, which
returned 0 for a slot-only card (no `e.target`/`card.target`), so the `<=0 → don't cast`
gate dropped it; new `scoreFightExchange` scores the combatant exchange off operands, so
the AI now casts Predate/Prey Upon when favorable and declines bad trades (verified via
`AI.decide`). Card-text renders "<A> fights <B>" from operands, pronoun "it" when a prior
clause named A (Predate). Re-authored all 3 fight cards + added prey_upon (283 cards).
1373 green, lint clean, 500-game selfplay clean (0 crashes/violations/stuck).

v2.0.81: **decompose `fight_target` → a `fight` primitive with two operands**
(supersedes v2.0.80's `fighter_slot` bolt-on, now that Predate gives a second,
differently-shaped fight card — the real threshold for the abstraction). The
mechanic (two creatures deal LIVE power to each other, simultaneously) is now
separated from the fighter-selection policy: `fight` deals with the **targeted**
creature (`target`, the standard target machinery) and a **fighter** named by a
uniform `fighter` selector — `{slot:N}` (an explicitly-targeted creature, read
from `ctx.allTargets`; Predate's buffed creature) or `{select:'highest_power_yours'}`
(our biggest, the one-sided fight cards' auto-pick, now **explicit in card data**
instead of hard-coded in the handler). New `resolveFighter` helper. The asymmetry
(B is "the target," A is a selector) is the engine's grain: legality/enumeration
are effect-driven via `target_slot` (isLegalAction/`validTargetsBySlot`), so every
player-chosen target must be claimed by an effect's slot — a second off-slot operand
would break enumeration. Re-authored all three fight cards onto it (Predate +
Beast's Fury + Apex Hunter); renamed the kind across the 8 consumer sites (AI
valuation/cast-scoring/classification sets, card-text, the creature-effect +
harmful-kind lists, the generator param map). Card-text renders "it fights …"
(slot fighter, named in a prior clause) vs "your strongest creature fights …"
(select). `test_predate_fight_d1.js` grew an end-to-end cast (AI resolves Predate
through the real stack, fight uses the boosted power). 1369 green, lint clean,
300-game selfplay clean (0 crashes/violations/stuck).

v2.0.80: **Predate (new card) + the D1 live-read hybrid it forces + a static-lord
keyword-grant regression test.** (1) **Predate** — {1}{G} Sorcery: "Target creature
you control gets +1/+1 until end of turn, then it fights target creature an
opponent controls." Reuses the already-existing `fight_target` effect, extended
with an optional `fighter_slot`: with it, the fighter is the explicitly-targeted
(and buffed) creature read from `ctx.allTargets` (mirroring `apply_in_game_splice`)
instead of the auto-picked biggest; without it, the existing Beast's Fury/Apex
Hunter auto-pick path is byte-unchanged. `ctx.allTargets` is now threaded onto the
spell and trigger resolution ctx (the ability ctx already had it). Card-text renders
"…then it fights …" via a buff-then-fight idiom + a pronoun render of `fight_target`
when `fighter_slot` is set. (2) **D1 hybrid (DIVERGENCE §3.6), now closed.** A
`{from:'target_*'}` expression reads LIVE state while the target is still on the
battlefield (so Predate's pump counts in the fight), and falls back to the
last-known-info snapshot once the target has left its zone (Swords/Exorcist: exile,
then gain life = its power). `liveTargetView` keys off `findCard` (battlefield-only =
"still in its expected zone"). Behavior-preserving for the only two current
expression users (both exile-then-read → departed → snapshot, unchanged). (3) New
`test_predate_fight_d1.js` (14) covering both fight paths, both halves of the hybrid,
and — filling a real gap — the **static-lord keyword grant** (`applyStaticKeywordGrants`,
exposed for tests alongside `clearRestrictionsFromSource`): Goblin Chieftain grants a
fellow Goblin haste, not itself, not a non-Goblin, and the grant clears on leave-play.
1363 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean (0 crashes/violations/stuck).

v2.0.79: **Equatorial Artificer review cleanup + keeper art.** Guarded
`colors_of_source` so future callers cannot accidentally pay it without a source
card, pinned Artifice Triumphant's AI valuation as intentionally tempo-like, and
documented `innate`, `spend_mana_as_any_color`, `colors_of_source`, and
`grant_activated_ability` in `docs/PROTOCOL.md`. Added selected PixelLab art for
Equatorial Engine, Artifice Triumphant, and Ingenuity Unbounded.

v2.0.78: **Artifice Triumphant's intentionally dubious colorless target.** The
AI still strongly prefers to neutralize a colored creature, but now assigns a
colorless creature a score floor of 1 instead of rejecting it. If that is the
only available target, the boss may grant the player the amusing zero-mana
reactivation mutation. The activation's rules are unchanged: its cost remains
one mana of each of the creature's colors, which is zero for a colorless card.

v2.0.77: **Equatorial Artificer colorless boss.** Added the boss deck and its
three special cards: Equatorial Engine (Artifact Land, `{T}: Add {C}{C}`),
Artifice Triumphant ({3} flash Sorcery that permanently turns a creature into an
Artifact and grants it a color-cost activation to become a Creature until EOT),
and Ingenuity Unbounded ({1} innate Artifact with hexproof, indestructible, and
"spend mana as any color"). Small engine seams: intrinsic `innate` card data,
`spend_mana_as_any_color`, dynamic `colors_of_source` activation costs, and
run-persistent `set_types` / `grant_activated_ability` stickers composed through
the existing `apply_sticker` primitive. Added `test_equatorial_artificer_boss.js`;
the boss uses 10 Equatorial Engines and no other lands, so Ingenuity unlocks a
suite of demanding colored spells.

v2.0.76: **two cards landed from PRs #30/#31 (rebuilt on the v2.0 model) + their
small engine seams.** Both PRs predated the v2.0 refactor by ~292 commits and no
longer applied; reimplemented in their *ambitious* designs (from the prior
instance's handoff notes), not the simplified versions that were committed.
(1) **Heir to the Burnt House** — {3}{B} 3/3, "When this dies, target opponent
sacrifices a land." The only engine work was making the `chooses()` edict filter
**type-symmetric**: `choosesEligiblePool` now treats the filter as a type name, so
`'land'` narrows via `hasType` exactly like `'creature'`/`'permanent'` (a chooses
filter IS a type — no bespoke land primitive; PR #30's obsolete `destroyLand` is
gone). Added `'land'` to `TARGET_FILTERS` **and** a backing `case 'land'` in
`targetsForFilter` (→ `permanent` + `{type:'Land'}`, honoring the §3.5
add-it-in-both-places invariant); the empty-pool/human-prompt nouns and the
card-text sacrifice clause derive from the filter ("sacrifices a land").
(2) **The False Witness** — {2}{U}{U} **0/1** Flash Insect Shapeshifter doppelganger.
Decomposed onto primitives: ETB `move_card`(bf→exile) + the one new effect
**`become_copy_of`**; leave `move_card`(exile→bf) via a new `copy_source` selector
(exile→bf already returns under the owner's control). `become_copy_of` reuses the
engine's materialize-then-re-derive pattern (like keyword/type grants): it writes
the copied creature's printed characteristics onto the instance and rides the
auto-reverting `typeGrants` layer for types (+ kept Insect/Shapeshifter);
`resetInPlayState` re-derives the base on **every** leave path *before* the leave
event fires, so the revert is free and the witness's own leave-return trigger is
never clobbered by the copied triggers (the load-bearing subtlety — a copy effect
only applies on the battlefield, like MTG). AI: `abilityValue` scores the copy
package strongly (so the AI casts/drafts it); `pickBestTriggerTarget` copies the
opponent's biggest threat (by `sacValueOnBoard`, not cost-adjusted value);
`flashETBWouldFizzle` won't flash it into an empty board. New `heir_edict_test.js`
(11) + `false_witness_test.js` (23). 1347 green, lint clean, 800-game selfplay
clean (0 crashes/violations/stuck/runaways).

v2.0.74: **trigger labels are now generated, not hand-authored (log + stack pill).** Removed 93 hand-maintained trigger `text` labels from card.json; the game log and the stack pill now derive a trigger's one-line English from its effects via a new `triggerLogText()` seam (authored-if-present → generated → raw event name). Only `custom_text` cards keep authored labels — exactly `archdemon_of_bargains` (its bespoke bargain effects don't generate). The presence of a `text` field is now the opt-out signal; no runtime flag check. Verified the seam degrades NOWHERE post-strip (0 cards fall back to event name). This kills a class of drift bug (the old ancient_treant label said "fetch a Forest" — the card fetches any land). ARCHITECTURE: the engine calls `triggerLogText` (in card-text.js) to write its log — a proto-only coupling shortcut, documented as a Godot "do NOT replicate" divergence (Godot engine stays UI-free → emits a structured signal, presentation renders). Isolated behind ONE named call so the migration is a clean swap. 1313 green, 200-game selfplay clean (exercises the engine→text log path), lint clean.

v2.0.75: **code-review fixes from PR #37.** Three real Proto bugs + doc hygiene. (1) `matchFilter` ignored `filter.type`, so the four "target land" spells (`awaken_the_vault`, `golem_forge`, `living_lands`, `sudden_vines` — `target:"permanent"` + `target_filter:{type:"Land"}`) accepted ANY permanent; added a `filter.type` branch mirroring the existing `subtype` one (reads through `hasType`, so animate/type-change is respected). (2) The `flash` keyword never rendered on sorceries — `describeCardSegments` gated the keyword preamble behind `hasType(card,'Creature')`, so post-Instant-retirement spells (e.g. Lightning Bolt = `Sorcery`+`flash`) showed no "Flash"; now a `SPELL_LEGAL_KEYWORDS` set (currently just `flash`) surfaces spell-legal keywords on non-creatures while keeping combat keywords off spells. (3) Guarded an unguarded `f.card.keywords.includes('haste')` in the activate-ability path (threw if `keywords` was undefined; siblings already guarded). Plus: documented the DELIBERATE type-agnosticism of tribal subtype triggers (`anotherCreatureYouEntersOfSubtype` intentionally omits `card_is_creature` — an "Artifact — Goblin" IS a Goblin; the `card_has_subtype` term is the gate) after a review pass wrongly "fixed" it into a regression and it was reverted; refreshed stale comments (`card_has_subtype`'s dead-`sub`-field note, a load-bearing-order note on `_condSignature`). Godot-side loader/timing findings (latent — `JsonCardLoader` is diagnostic-only today) are documented as Part 1 blockers in `docs/plan-card-data-unification.md`; two Proto cleanup items (stickers.js raw `types[]` access, cost→brace-string dedupe) queued in BACKLOG. 1313 green, lint clean.

v2.0.73: **fix land-fetch text generation (was hardcoded "basic land").** The `move_card` library→battlefield describe branch in `card-text.js` hardcoded "search your library for a basic land", ignoring the effect filter — so all 5 land-fetch cards (ancient_treant, forest_forager, great_herder, rampant_growth, verdant_outrider, all `filter:{type:Land}`) read "basic land" when the filter is actually ANY land. Now derives the noun from the filter (subtype > type > "card"), mirroring the fetch-to-hand case → "a land". Surfaced while comparing authored trigger labels vs generated text: the authored ancient_treant label even said "a Forest" (just wrong) — a poster-child for why generated text that can't drift from the effect is the right direction. 1313 green, lint clean.

v2.0.72: **route the in-game search modal through the shared card-picker too.**
Follow-up to v2.0.71: `searchModal` (the library-search / tutor picker) had the
same `makeCardEl → cursor → onclick → append` loop as the meta pickers, so it now
calls `renderCardPicker`. Extended the helper with two opts (back-compat — the
existing three callers pass none): `scale` (default 2; the search list passes
`null` for native card size since it can be long) and `emptyHtml` (the "No
matching cards." state). Four flows now share one render loop; the search *modal*
stays its own container (in-game effect resolution, not a meta pick — correctly
NOT merged). Browser-only path — verify by resolving a tutor (e.g. Demonic Tutor)
in-game. Engine suite 1313 green (no engine change), lint clean.

v2.0.71: **unify the card-pick modals + Mist Raider Spirit + fix synthetic-card type line.**
Three changes. (1) Mist Raider is now a Spirit (was Human; Pirate kept). (2) Fixed
a v2.0.70 cutover regression: `makeSyntheticCard` still emitted `type`/`sub`, so
synthetic display cards (the trigger pill on the stack, the Mystery reward, the
boon fallback) rendered a BLANK type line — it now folds the caller's type/sub
into `types[]` (browser-only path, which is why no test/selfplay caught it). (3)
Unified the three "pick a card" flows that had drifted apart: the draft pack, the
Neow boons (`#neowModal`), and the post-draft land offer (`#postDraftOfferModal`,
which used one-off inline styles). The `Modal` show/hide infra was already shared;
the *card-row render loop* was triplicated and the two one-shot popups were
separate modals. Now: one `renderCardPicker(host, items, onPick)` helper renders
all three rows; the two popups collapse into one generic `#cardPickModal` with
`.picker-*` classes (accent-tintable per flow, colors row self-hides when empty),
styled on the draft as the rich baseline. The land offer now also shows the
drafted-deck color HUD. The draft stays a full screen (persistent, not a one-shot)
but shares the same render loop. NOTE: all UI/DOM-render code is browser-only and
NOT covered by the node suite or self-play — verify the draft / boon / land
screens in the actual page. Engine suite 1313 green (no engine change), syntax
clean, no dangling refs.

v2.0.70: **type-system cutover — `types[]` is the SOLE source of truth; `type`/`sub` deleted.**
Closed the v2.0.67 dual-write window for real (review-flagged). Previously every
card stored its type identity twice (legacy `type`+`sub` AND `types[]`); now the
legacy fields are gone everywhere — card data, runtime instances, tokens, and
`typesOf`'s derivation branch. All engine/render reads go through the accessors
(`hasType` / `subtypesOf` / `governingType` / `isPermanent` / `typeLine`); added
`subtypesOf()` as the one replacement for the `card.sub.split()` idiom. Reworked
the staple-merge + subtype-roll + sticker-view write paths to produce `types[]`
directly (subtype unions, the Artifact co-type, animate grants). Deleted `type`/
`sub` from all 279 card JSONs (guarded by `types[]` presence) and deduped the
arrays (`["Land","Basic","Land"]` → `["Land","Basic"]`). Migrated ~60 test
pool-filters to `hasType` and ~40 `{type,sub}` fixtures to `{types:[...]}`,
including the 5 JS `TOKENS`; rewrote `test_types_identity` (the accessors ARE the
definition now, so its legacy-equivalence half was retired). The cutover was the
"~50 readers" named in v2.0.69's BACKLOG — that item is now removed (done).
Gotchas the sweep surfaced: the `counter`-style overload trap again (a
`pendingSearch.filter.type` mangled into `hasType(filter,…)` — reverted, it's a
filter param not a card); `.test(card.type)` regex reads the `=== 'X'` script
missed (→ `isPermanent`/`governingType`); and a selfplay false-positive where the
`bfCreaturesHaveStats` invariant checked raw `c.power` (undefined for an animated
land whose stats live in the grant layer) — switched to effective `getStats`,
matching its sibling invariant. 1313 green, lint clean, boot validation clean,
400-game selfplay clean (0 violations).

v2.0.69: **art paths are now relative/derived (rename-proof) + named the type/sub cutover.**
Follow-up to the v2.0.68 art fix, addressing the structural root cause a review
flagged: instead of storing a full `cards/<id>/art.png` (folder name baked in, so
a rename stales it — the v2.0.67 break), image art is now stored as a BARE
filename (`art.png`, Elystra's ladder `art-1/2/3.png`) and `effectiveArt` resolves
it against the card's OWN folder via `resolveArtPath` (`cards/<tplId>/<file>`). A
future folder rename can't reintroduce the bug — the path is derived from the
current id, never stored. Migrated 84 base + 3 ladder paths to bare filenames
(guarded: only when the path's folder matched the card's own id — 0 cross-folder).
Emoji / data: / http / full-path values pass through untouched (back-compat).
Deleted the now-dead `artHtml` helper (zero callers, and it built `<img>` from a
bare string with no card context — a footgun on the new format). Locked the
derivation with rename-proof tests. Also added a BACKLOG item naming the
`type`/`sub` → `types[]` cutover (delete the legacy fields, migrate the ~50 direct
readers to governingType()/hasType()) so the v2.0.67 dual-write window doesn't
calcify. 1310 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.68: **fix broken art paths from the v2.0.67 id rename.** The rename sweep
git-renamed each card's folder (carrying its `art.png` along) but did NOT update
the hardcoded `"art": "cards/<oldId>/art.png"` STRING inside `card.json` — so 75
image-art cards pointed at folders that no longer existed (broken art in-game).
Rewrote each art path to its own (new) folder; the png was already sitting there
from the folder rename. Elystra needed extra care: it has a multi-rung
`art_ladder` (`art-1/2/3.png`, stat-driven) — fixed the base `art` AND all 3
ladder rung paths. Final exhaustive recursive scan: all 87 `cards/...` path
strings across every card JSON now resolve. 1303 green, lint clean.

v2.0.67: **card-id normalization + types[] on every card (big mechanical sweep).**
Two consistency passes, one commit: (1) Added an explicit `types[]` to all 264
single-type cards (additive — `type`/`sub` kept, still load-bearing for the 52
un-migrated direct reads; matches how the 15 multi-type cards were already
authored). (2) Renamed 244 card ids so `id === slug(name)` (snake_case, drop
leading The/A/An, possessive `'s`→`s`): `bolt`→`lightning_bolt`,
`diabolicEdict`→`diabolic_edict`, `archmage`→`archmage_of_veils`, etc. — zero
collisions, all 279 now match. 23 of 31 Godot-shared ids auto-align (Godot was
already named-after-card). Folders git-renamed (history preserved), manifest
regenerated, all ~415 reference sites swept (quoted, dot-access, and
object-key forms), and all 248 old→new pairs added to `TPLID_RENAMES` so old
saves migrate (verified idempotent).
Gotchas the sweep surfaced + fixed: the `counter` EFFECT KIND collides with the
`counter` card (→ `counterspell`) — reverted ~8 effect-kind strings the rename
wrongly touched (engine valuation sets, `EFFECT_POSITIONAL`, card-text case,
predicate test data); subtype ROLLS appended to `card.sub` but `typesOf` now
reads `types[]`, so the lord buff stopped matching — `applyStickersToCard` now
pushes the rolled subtype onto `types[]` too; several tests keyed off
`!card.types` (legacy-format) or pool-order-first creatures (a flyer skewed an
AI sim) — de-brittled. 1303 green, lint clean, 400-game selfplay clean, boot
validation clean. Godot side untouched.

v2.0.66: **fix: Steal on a STAPLED creature gave only the base, dropping the staple.**
The steal capture (`EFFECTS.steal`) only read `stapledTpls` from a player-side run
SLOT. An opponent's permanent has no slot, so the else-branch set `meta = undefined`
and the card was rebuilt from its bare base `tplId` — stealing an opp's
savannahLions+furnaceWhelp gave you a 2/1, not the merged 4/4 flying. The merged
identity is on the runtime card's `stapledFrom`; the fix copies `stapledTpls` (and
the instance's empower/subtype rolls) on the no-slot path so the thief gets the
whole stapled card. Regression in test_change_control (steal an opp stapled
creature → stolen card is 4/4 flying with stapledTpls). 1303 green, lint clean,
400-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.65: **two more Land+Spell staple ETB fixes (cost sticker + drain timing).**
(1) A `cost_mod` sticker on the stapled spell now adjusts the ETB's
`optional_cost`, not just the (vestigial, free-land) `card.cost` — a "−1 cost"
Mind Rot staple now correctly reads "you may pay {B}" instead of "{B}{1}".
(2) Pending triggered abilities now drain onto the stack in `step()` as soon as
priority is open (MTG 603.3b) — a trigger queued by a special action like
playing a land used to sit in the queue until the player's NEXT priority pass,
so a staple ETB appeared to "fire the next time you do something" and never
visibly hit the stack. Now it's on the stack immediately. (This also covers the
"are these going on the stack?" question — yes, and now promptly.) The card-text
fix for these (renders "target opponent discards 2 cards" + the reduced cost) was
already in v2.0.64's target-step carry; the screenshots were from the deployed
`dev` build, which is behind `Refactor`. 1299 green, lint clean, 500-game
selfplay clean.

v2.0.64: **fix: AI froze ("hung") on a land+spell ETB — staple dropped the spell's
target step.** When a spell is stapled onto a permanent, the synthesized ETB
trigger copied the spell's *effects* but NOT its top-level `target()` step. A
migrated targeted spell (bolt = `target()` + a BARE `damage` effect) thus ran a
TARGETLESS damage on resolve → null-target deref in `applyDamageFrom`. That
uncaught throw fired inside `executeAction` during the AI's turn and froze the
game (the reported "hang"). Surfaced on Land+Spell staples via the optional-paid
ETB, but it's any permanent+targeted-spell staple. Fix: `synthesizeStapledTemplate`
now carries `target`/`target_filter` (and `target_slots`, for multi-target spells)
onto the ETB trigger, so the trigger picks a target (AI auto-picks; human gets the
prompt) and the bare effects operate on it. The existing optional-ETB test only
stapled an UNtargeted spell (goblinRabble), which is why it missed this — added a
regression with a targeted staple (bolt) driven to resolution. 1296 green, lint
clean, 400-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.63: **Scarification text now reflects empower (was a frozen custom_text).**
Scarification was `custom_text` with a hardcoded "Destroy target creature. Scar
it: ..." — so an empower(severity)-stickered copy still read "Destroy" even
though it mechanically EXILES (the instance effect IS promoted; only the text was
wrong). It's the ONLY custom_text card with an empowerable effect. Fix: dropped
custom_text + the stored text, and taught `describeEffectList` the Scarification
idiom (affect_creature + apply_sticker(scarified)) — the removal verb is now
rendered via `describeEffect` (tracks the empower-promoted severity AND
bump-highlights), with the scar rider as a literal (the life-loss isn't an
empower target). Base text is byte-identical to the old authored string; an
empowered copy now reads "Exile target creature. Scar it: ...". 1293 green, lint
clean. (Also logged a Godot-side backlog item: Godot displays `template.text`
directly, so port `describeCardText` there — the stripped cards render blank
oracle text until then.)

v2.0.62: **minimap advance is now a universal select-then-Continue flow.** Revises
v2.0.61's interaction: instead of click-to-advance, clicking a legal node now
SELECTS it (highlighted, not committed) and the always-present Continue button
commits the selection. Applied uniformly — one option or many, you select then
Continue. Continue stays disabled until a legal node is selected when there's a
choice; for the no-node-choice transitions (resume in-progress node / fresh next
sector) it's enabled immediately. Reverted v2.0.61's adaptive title/subtitle copy
back to the simple `hasChoice` form ("Choose Your Path" / "Your Path"). The
`recordResult` change from v2.0.61 (any next node — 1 or many — is offered as a
pendingChoice) stays. `selectMapNode` replaces `pickMapNodeClick`; new
`.map-node.selected` + `#mapContinue:disabled` styles. 1290 green, lint clean.

v2.0.61: **unified the minimap advance UI — single successor is now click-the-node.**
The map showed a fork (2+ paths) as clickable nodes but a single path as a
separate "Continue" button (auto-advanced via startNextGame). Pointless
divergence. Now `recordResult` offers ANY next node (1 or many) as a
`pendingMapChoice` — a single successor is a one-option click, identical UI to a
fork. The Continue button now only appears for the genuinely no-node-choice
transitions: resuming the in-progress node, or dropping into a freshly-generated
next sector. startNextGame keeps its single-successor auto-advance solely as a
back-compat fallback for pre-2.0.61 saves (pendingChoice null + visited current).
Map copy adapts: "Choose Your Path" only for true forks, "Your Path / click the
next node" for one. 1290 green, lint clean.

v2.0.60: **colorless cards are now offered in every draft slot.** `rollPack`
buckets the pool by WUBRG `color`; colorless cards (`color:null` — robots,
colorless artifacts, artifact lands) landed in no bucket, so the color-rolled
slots never picked them — colorless creatures appeared in 0% of packs. Fixed:
colorless is a separate always-eligible pool added to EVERY slot's candidates
(it fits any deck, so it isn't "a color the player isn't" and isn't subject to
the off-color once-per-pack cap). Also fixed the off-color dedup to only drop the
rolled color when the slot actually picked a card OF that color (a colorless pick
no longer consumes it). Measured: colorless creatures ~14%/slot, ~37% of packs
have one (was 0). draft_pool_lazy_test had two STALE assertions (`type !== 'Land'`
excluded artifact lands, which only passed because they were never offered) —
realigned to the true draftPool predicate + a regression that colorless creatures
actually appear. 1289 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.59: **basic-land subtypes autogrant their mana ability (MTG 305.6).** A Land
with the Plains/Island/Swamp/Mountain/Forest subtype now DERIVES the matching
"{T}: Add {C}" ability at ingest (`ingestCard`), unless it already produces that
color. So the 5 colored artifact lands dropped their hand-authored tap ability —
the subtype is now the single source (add the subtype, get the mana). drossPylon
keeps its explicit {C} (colorless has no color subtype to derive from); basic
lands carry sub "Basic Land" (not a color subtype) so they're unaffected and keep
their explicit ability. Materialized onto the template at load, so every
`card.abilities` consumer (tap legality, landProducibleColors, AI, render) works
unchanged. Verified end-to-end (gildedSeat taps for {W}). 1287 green, lint clean.

v2.0.58: **card tweaks — artifact-land subtypes + architectsCodex is an artifact.**
Added basic land subtypes to the 5 colored artifact lands so they read "Artifact
Land — Swamp" etc. (gildedSeat→Plains, tidalConduit→Island, boneReliquary→Swamp,
emberAnvil→Mountain, verdantVerge→Forest; drossPylon stays "Artifact Land" —
colorless has no basic type). architectsCodex is now an Artifact Creature
("— Wizard Artificer"). Both follow the robot pattern: the subtype lives IN
`types[]` (typesOf ignores legacy `sub` when types[] is present), with `sub`
mirrored. Purely type-line/tag changes — nothing auto-grants mana or behavior
from a basic-land subtype here (the engine keys mana off template IDs, not
subtypes), and governingType is unchanged (lands govern as Land, codex as
Creature). NOTE (logged, not fixed): colorless creatures are never offered in
classic draft — rollPack buckets the pool by WUBRG `color`, and colorless cards
(`color:null`) land in no bucket (0 appearances in 6000 pack slots). 1275 green,
lint clean.

v2.0.57: **fix: multi-slot (`target_slots`) cards were uncastable in the real UI.**
`makeCard` copied `target`/`target_filter` to the instance but NOT `target_slots`,
so every multi-target card (drainLife, branchingBolt, twinStrike,
rootsAndBranches, swordAndSorcery) lost its slot specs on instantiation —
`probeTargetsForObject` found no slots, fell back to the per-effect path (which
can't resolve slot filters), returned null, and `canPlayFromUI` reported the card
uncastable (even with valid targets on board). The whole test_targeting_cast
suite MASKED it: its `mk()` helper does `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(template))`,
deep-copying everything including target_slots, so the cards "worked" in tests but
not in real play. Fix: makeCard deep-copies `target_slots` (incl. each spec's
optional target_filter) to the instance. Added a regression block that uses the
REAL `ENGINE.makeCard` (not the deep-copy helper) to assert the field survives +
the card probes castable. 1275 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.56: **indefinite article in type-change text.** Petrify read "becomes
Artifact" (missing article). Added an `indefiniteArticle(phrase)` helper in
card-text.js and threaded it through the one `add_type`/`set_types` phrase
builder, so type-change spells now read "becomes an Artifact" / "also becomes a
3/3 Creature". The picker is letter-based for words (vowel-initial → "an") and
pronunciation-based for a leading number (P/T like "3/3" → "a three…", but
"8/8"/"80" → "an eight…", teens "11"/"18" → "an"). Deliberately scoped to type
lines — not a general English a/an solver (won't catch "a unicorn"/"an honor",
which don't occur in generated text). First feedback on the Phase-4 cards.
1269 green, lint clean.

v2.0.55: **strip the dead `text` field from card data (proto only).** Oracle text
is GENERATED procedurally from each card's effects/triggers/abilities
(`describeCardText`); the hand-written top-level `text` field in the JSON was
*never read* on the render path for procedural cards — it was a vestige that could
silently rot out of sync. Measured the render impact per-card (rendered text with
vs without the stored field) and stripped it from the 245 cards where it provably
changes nothing (239 procedural + 6 artifact lands, which now render empty rules
text with mana on the frame, like every basic land). Kept it ONLY where it's
load-bearing: the 9 `custom_text` authored cards, `mercurialAdept` (its per-game
rolled ability can't be described statically — marked `custom_text: true` to make
that explicit), and `squireOath` (a true vanilla creature whose `text` is genuine
flavor). New `test_no_dead_text.js` guards against regression: a top-level `text`
is allowed only when it actually affects rendered output (render-identical-without
→ dead → fail). Zero rendered-text change (card_text goldens unchanged).
**Cross-engine note:** the Godot port DISPLAYS `template.text` directly
(`scenes/card.gd`) rather than generating it, so these cards now render blank
oracle text in Godot until it grows its own procedural text-gen (user-approved
tradeoff). 1264 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.54: **bugfix found by a test-quality pass — permanent animate dies at EOT.**
While de-brittling `test_type_change` (replacing a hand-emulated cleanup sweep
with a REAL end-of-turn drive), the test caught a real Phase-4 bug:
`applyTypeChange` stored a *permanent*-duration animate's power/toughness in the
EOT-cleared `tempPower`/`tempTou`. So a "becomes a 2/2 creature permanently" land
kept its Creature TYPE past end of turn (correct) but lost its STATS (wrong) →
0/0 creature → died to SBA at the first cleanup. Fixed: a permanent animate now
writes `permPower`/`permTou` (which survive EOT and reset only on leave-play,
matching the type grant's lifetime); eot animates still use temp stats. The
hand-copied sweep had masked it (it cleared stats + type together, so the test
never saw a creature-with-zero-stats survive into SBA) — exactly the argument for
driving the real path. The test now drives a real turn / real bounce. 1260 green,
lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.53: **edicts revert to in-place battlefield selection (no popup).** The
human-facing forced-sacrifice (Diabolic/Vile Edict) used a dedicated
`edictChoiceModal`; it now reverts to the simpler/clearer original behavior — the
player's eligible permanents glow on the battlefield (a new `pendingEdictChoice`
branch in the per-card render adds `.targetable` from `pendingEdictChoice.pool`)
and a click sacks one (`clickBattlefield` → `edictChoice`, alongside the existing
trigger-target branch). The `Modal.show('edictChoiceModal')` block (and its
button-building loop) is removed; a defensive `Modal.hide` remains, and the now-
dormant modal DOM element is left in the HTML (hidden, harmless). The status bar
already announces the prompt. Engine behavior — the `edictChoice` action,
pause/replay, out-of-pool rejection, AI auto-pick — is unchanged; only the UI
trigger moved. `test_edict_human_choice` adds source-wiring assertions (click
routes to edictChoice; pool glows; no modal show; status bar text). **The in-
browser click feel is NOT verified in this environment (no browser); user to
confirm on dev.** 1283 green, lint clean.

v2.0.52: **Archdemon of Bargains LTB bugfix** — the leaves-play payout now uses the
SAME number chosen at ETB. `bargain_sticker_other` read `ctx.event.card` (always
undefined — zone-change events carry the dying card as `subject_card`), so N
silently defaulted to 1, decoupling the payout from the bargain. Fixed to
`(ctx.event && ctx.event.subject_card) || ctx.sourceCard` (the demon in the
graveyard still carries `bargainsNum`, which survives `resetInPlayState`).
`test_bargain_chooser_and_empower` now drives both halves end-to-end and asserts
N(payout) === N(chosen). Also removed two stale combat comments (an unimplemented
double-strike "TODO" and a misleading deathtouch-dump note — replaced with a
correctness rationale for why the leftover-damage dump intentionally skips the
deathtouch tag). 1280 green, lint clean.

v2.0.51: **staple same-class UNION** — closes the type-system arc (the last
parked item, now needed because Phase 4 made multi-type cards draftable AND
stapleable). `synthesizeStapledTemplate` now unions the **Artifact/Enchantment
co-types** onto the merged permanent: stapling an artifact creature keeps it an
Artifact Creature (was silently dropping Artifact, since `mergeStapleInto` only
touched `type`/`sub`). Deliberately NOT unioned: Creature/Land governance —
Land+Creature still collapses to a cast creature (play-vs-cast gates on
`hasType('Land')`; true land-creatures remain out of scope), and stapled spells
still collapse to an ETB. An explicit `types[]` is authored on the merged card
only when a co-type is present, so single-type staples are byte-identical. The
union also carries merged subtypes (so a stapled "X Golem" reads "Artifact
Creature — … Golem"). `test_type_change` +5 staple assertions. 1274 green, lint
clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.42: resolved three rules-infrastructure divergences (B2 / F2 / D4 — all now
*PROTO: DONE* in DIVERGENCE). **B2** — unused mana now empties at *every* phase
boundary (MTG 106.4), not only CLEANUP. New `setPhase(p)` helper empties both
pools on an actual change; all 11 phase-progression assignments route through it,
the redundant CLEANUP clear is gone. Direct `G.phase = …` (test setup) bypasses
it, so pre-loaded pools survive until real play advances a phase. **F2** —
indestructible creatures now KEEP their marked damage (SBA only skips the death
check, doesn't heal); if indestructible is removed later the same turn, the
retained lethal damage kills it at the next SBA (MTG-correct). Damage clears at
end of turn with everything else. **D4** — `damagePlayer` now fires the
directional `life_changed(delta<0)`, so "whenever you lose life" (`is_life_loss`)
triggers fire from burn/combat too, not only from `gain_life(negative)`/drain.
Safe: no card uses `is_life_loss` yet, and `is_life_gain` needs delta>0 so a
negative delta can't mis-fire it. (gain_life's signed half was already done.) New
test_rules_infra.js (7 checks). 1198 green, lint clean, 400-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.41: optional paid ETB for Land+Spell staples (BACKLOG feature). A spell
stapled onto a LAND used to give a FREE ETB trigger (a land is free to play, so
that's pure value); it's now a "you may pay {the spell's mana cost}" trigger.
Two new general primitives: (1) **optional triggers + cost-payment during
resolution** — a trigger may carry `optional_cost`; at resolution `resolveTrigger`
pauses on a new `pendingOptionalCost` decision (registered in PENDING_DECISIONS),
and on pay `doOptionalCost` calls `payMana` (which auto-taps) then
`runTriggerEffects` (split out of resolveTrigger so the pay path resumes it).
Targets are already locked at queue time, so the order is target → may-pay →
effect. Can't-afford auto-declines (no prompt). Gated at synthesis: only
`merged.type === 'Land'` staples get `optional_cost`; Creature/artifact bases
stay free (you paid the body). New action `optionalCost {pay}`, AI pays when
`spellValueForEffects > 0`, card-text renders "...you may pay {cost}: <effect>",
and a DOM modal (`#optionalCostModal`, mirrors the edict modal — browser-verify).
These primitives are reusable for kicker-style "you may pay" effects. New
test_optional_paid_etb.js (16 checks: synthesis gate, pay/decline/can't-pay flow,
AI decision). 1192 green, lint clean, 200-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.40: AI audit follow-ups. (1) `decideMain` now sequences main-phase casts by
play VALUE, not raw mana cost — so cheap high-impact removal beats expensive
filler (the audit's quality finding). Extracted `bestSpellPlay` (returns
{opt, score}) from `pickBestTargetForSpell` (now a thin wrapper) + a new
`spellPlayValue` cross-card scale (targeted → target score, creature →
getCardValue, utility → effect value); cost-descending stays as the tiebreak so
creatures still curve out biggest-first. All castable plays still get made
across successive priority passes, just in value order. (2) Dropped the
nonsensical `!flying` exemption in damage-vs-creature scoring (damage never
destroys an indestructible creature, flying or not). (3) Removed a dead
`bestAbilityScore` write in `decideOffTurnCombat` (the real gate is
`pickBestActivation`'s `<= 0 → null`). Kept `is_life_loss` predicate (intentional
pair with `is_life_gain`). New test_ai_main_sequencing.js (removal over filler).
1176 green, lint clean, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.39: corrected the Archdemon bargain chooser DIRECTION (v2.0.38 had it
backwards) + made the AI's bargain pick position-aware. Clarified intent: you
make a bargain WITH the demon — its NON-controller (opponent) picks 1-5; that
many stickers go on the demon's controller now, and the chooser collects that
many when they kill it. So the chooser is `opp(controller)`, not the controller.
v2.0.38 set it to the controller (backwards — it broke the common boss case:
boss-controlled should prompt the human, opp(boss)=you). Now correct both ways:
boss controls → human picks; player controls (drafted/stolen) → AI picks. The
original `who:'you'` was accidentally right for boss-control and only wrong when
the player controls it. AI pick: new `bargainPick(state, who)` ties N to a rough
life+board advantage (ahead → 5, behind → 1) instead of always the minimum —
the AI collects N when it kills the demon, so it bargains high when it can
afford the buff and expects the kill. choice_prompts_test reverted to the
correct non-controller ('you' for an opp-controlled demon); new test covers both
control directions + the position scaling. 1173 green, lint clean, 200-game
selfplay clean.

v2.0.38: two gameplay bug fixes (user-reported). (1) Archdemon of Bargains ETB
number-choice was hardcoded `who: 'you'`, so when the BOSS controlled the demon
the HUMAN got the prompt — choosing the boss's ETB sticker count AND their own
death payout. Now follows the demon's CONTROLLER (the dealmaker):
`who: sourceCard.controller`. When the boss controls it the boss (AI) chooses;
the human only chooses when they control it (cast/stolen). The ETB→controller /
LTB→opponent recipients were already correct — only the chooser was wrong.
(Note: the AI resolves its bargain pick at the min, 1 — a weak choice for a boss
that wants a buffed board; AI-tuning follow-up, not a bug.) Updated
choice_prompts_test, which had encoded the bug (opp-controlled demon yet expected
`who === 'you'`). (2) Empower on signed values: `applyEmpowerRoll` did
`field += amount`, so a -2 debuff (Sicken's pump) empowered to -1 (WEAKER), not
-3. Now amplifies magnitude in the field's existing direction
(`cur + (cur < 0 ? -amount : amount)`) — fixes pump debuffs and negative
gain_life (drains); positive fields (damage, buffs, counts) unchanged. New
test_bargain_chooser_and_empower.js (9 checks). 1170 green, lint clean,
150-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.37: AI scoring — single-target exile now outvalues destroy (user call).
In `spellValueForEffects`, the single-target `affect_creature` severity value was
tap 3 / bounce 4 / destroy=exile 12 (the v2.0.36 collapse of the dead `?12:12`).
Exile now scores 15 vs destroy's 12 — same board result, but it dodges death
triggers / indestructible / recursion / regeneration. (The activated-ability
path already ranked exile above destroy: 35 vs 30.) Also resolved the v2.0.36
gain_life open question: the removed dead branch ("valuable only when low":
ourLife<=6?6:…) was a cruder predecessor of the surviving signed-life branch in
`pickBestActivation`, which is strictly better (drain- + target- + amount-aware,
already low-life gated at ≤10). No swap — removal stands. 1161 green, lint clean,
150-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.36: added dev-only lint tooling + fixed the 5 bug-smells it immediately
found. ESLint (flat config, `reference/html-proto/eslint.config.js`) +
eslint-plugin-sonarjs, run via `npm run lint` from `reference/html-proto/`.
Dev-only — NOT in the runtime (no build step; Pages serves raw files);
`node_modules/` git-ignored, `package-lock.json` committed. Scope is narrow on
purpose: high-signal BUG rules only (sonarjs/no-identical-expressions +
no-identical-conditions + no-all-duplicated-branches, plus core no-dupe-else-if /
no-self-compare / no-constant-binary-expression / no-unreachable / dupe-keys|args|
case / etc.), no stylistic rules; `no-undef` off (plain <script>s share globals,
no modules). The motivating `x || x` case (v2.0.33's grant_haste) is exactly what
sonarjs/no-identical-expressions catches — verified. First run found 5 real
issues, all fixed: (1) ai.js single-target severity had a dead `sev===3?12:12`
ternary (collapsed to `12`, behavior-identical; left a note that destroy & exile
both score 12 here vs 10/14 in the all_opps branch — flagged as a tuning
question). (2) stickers.js had an unreachable `damage && scope` label branch
after the general `damage` branch, so mass-damage stickers were mislabeled
'damage' instead of 'damage to all' — folded the scope check into the damage
branch (cosmetic fix). (3) ai.js had a DUPLICATE `else if (eff.kind ===
'gain_life')` in the activated-ability scoring chain — the second (with a
"valuable only when low" heuristic: `ourLife<=6?6:ourLife<=12?2:0`) was dead,
since the first gain_life branch always caught it. Removed the dead branch
(behavior-preserving); OPEN QUESTION for the user — was that low-life heuristic
the intended scoring for gain_life abilities (in which case swap it in)? 1161
green, lint clean.

v2.0.35: unblocked + did the render() you/opp counter loop (review item #3,
deferred from v2.0.34). The five mirror pairs (life/library/graveyard/exile/hand
counts) collapsed into one `for (const w of ['you','opp'])` loop. The blocker
was an asymmetric element ID: the player's hand-COUNT span was `youHand2` (the
bare `youHand` id is the player's card *container*) while the opponent's was
`oppHand` — so a naive `w+'Hand'` loop would have written the count into the
card container and frozen the real count, a silent bug. Fixed by normalizing the
two count spans to `youHandCount`/`oppHandCount` (HTML + render.js); the `youHand`
container and `oppHandView` cardback area are untouched. Verified end-to-end (no
CSS or other JS referenced the old ids), so no behavior change. 1161 green.

v2.0.34: de-dup the two button-construction hotspots the v2.0.33 review flagged
(behavior-preserving; pixel-identical output). (1) Start screen: ~7 buttons each
hand-wrote their cssText + create/text/style/onclick/append boilerplate. Now a
`START_BTN_STYLE` table (primary/cube/discard/secondary/sandbox) + a
`makeStartBtn(parent, text, styleKey, onclick)` factory — showStartScreen
creates 0 buttons inline. (2) Choice modals (pick-a-number / symmetricize /
edict) each spelled out the same option-button create + lift-on-hover
(background swap + translateY) + onclick three times; now one
`makeChoiceButton(html, css, normalBg, hoverBg, onclick)` helper in render.js
(background moved out of the css string to `style.background` so the hover swap
can't drift from the base color). Browser-verify the start screen + the three
modal prompts look unchanged. 1161 green. (Deferred from the review: render()'s
you/opp pairs — blocked on the asymmetric `youHand2`/`oppHand` element IDs.)

v2.0.33: modularization-review cleanups (behavior-preserving). A code-health
sweep (3 parallel surveys, all findings verified against source before acting).
(1) `change_control` haste rider checked `grant_haste || grant_haste` — the same
field twice (copy-paste of the line above, which legitimately checks
`untap_on_take || untap`). Threaten (the only steal-with-haste card) supplies
`grant_haste`, so haste was always granted correctly — a redundant-clause
landmine that *looked* like a bug, not an actual one. Collapsed to a single
check at both sites (engine.js change_control handler + card-text.js rider
text). (2) Fixed a stale line-number reference in cards.js (cited a line that no
longer exists; now points at the function/module). Review notes (no code change
needed): an audit flagged effect handlers writing `G.pending*` as "boundary
violations" — but that's the prototype's by-design IIFE-state architecture (the
"don't touch globals from handlers" rule is the *Godot port's* discipline, root
CLAUDE.md "Patterns to NOT replicate"), and the `pending*` writes are consistent
across all five modal prompts. Real (deferred) duplication worth a future pass:
start-screen button construction + choice-modal button/hover styling repeat
inline cssText; render()'s you/opp pairs *look* loopable but the element IDs
aren't fully symmetric (`youHand2` vs `oppHand`) — a naive loop would break, so
that one needs care. 1161 green.

v2.0.32: three QA/devtools items (all browser-verify — DOM not covered by
Node). (1) Minimap de-dup: the v2.0.30 "always show map" change left
`continueFromMap` as a near-byte-identical twin of `pickMapNodeClick`'s tail;
both now route through one `advanceFromMap()` (fork pick resolves the node
choice first, Continue advances directly). Investigated the "multiple map GUIs"
worry: it's ONE `renderMap()` + ONE `#mapModal` with a justified `hasChoice`
conditional (fork = clickable nodes/no Continue; non-fork = Continue button) —
not duplicate functions; all referenced DOM (`#mapContinue`/`#mapSubtitle`)
exists, so no soft-lock. (2) New devtool toggle "Reveal AI opponent's hand"
(Settings → Devtools, beside the font picker) — `revealAiHand` SETTINGS key;
`renderOppHand` draws the AI's real cards face-up (read-only, no onclick)
instead of cardbacks. Factored both devtools checkboxes through a shared
`addDevtoolsToggle` helper. (3) Sandbox mode (start screen → "🔬 Sandbox"): a
RUN-less throwaway game on basic-land decks with a floating panel to spawn any
card into either player's hand/board and top up mana/life. `sandboxMode` guards
`onStateChange`/`gameOverClick` so it never touches a saved run; the all-basics
opp deck makes the AI naturally passive until you spawn onto its board. Static/
passive-opponent control is a planned follow-up. New `test_sandbox_spawn.js`
(18 checks: deck validity, RUN-less boot, spawning complete instances onto the
battlefield, 30 AI plies without crash). 1161 green.

v2.0.31: closed GAP 2 — the human-facing `chooses()` edict prompt. `chooses()`
(Diabolic Edict / Vile Edict) always auto-picked the lowest-sac-value permanent,
even when the player forced to sacrifice was the HUMAN — so a human edict-victim
had their creature chosen for them. Now, when the chooser is `'you'`,
`resolveTopOfStack`'s chooses-branch defers: it stashes the chosen-dependent
trailing effects (sacrifice/annihilate/rip) on a new `pendingEdictChoice` modal
(registered in PENDING_DECISIONS, so `step()`/`anyoneOwesDecision` pauses for the
pick) and `break`s — the spell still resolves to the graveyard. The human submits
an `edictChoice` action; `doEdictChoice` rebuilds a minimal ctx with the pick as
`ctx.chosen`, replays the trailing effects, and `drainTriggers()` (so a sacrificed
creature's death triggers — Blood Artist — still fire). The AI path is UNCHANGED:
the handler still auto-picks lowest sac-value for AI choosers, and `AI.decide`
resolves its own `pendingEdictChoice` the same way (so selfplay, where the
AI-driven `'you'` seat can be edicted, stays clean — caught a runaway regression
mid-build that the AI-resolution block fixed). Extracted `choosesEligiblePool` /
`choosesDescriptor` as the single source for auto-pick + prompt + enumeration.
New `test_edict_human_choice.js` (27 checks: prompt opens + creature not
auto-sac'd, the human's pick is honored over the AI's default, legality, the
human-edicts-AI regression guard, Blood Artist death-trigger drain, and Vile
Edict's annihilate+rip replay). DOM modal wired (`#edictChoiceModal`,
mirroring the symmetricize modal) — **browser-verify** (DOM not covered by Node).
1138 green, 200-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.30: minimap always shows between levels + boss-advance crash fix. (1) The
post-level map was only rendered when the current node forked (2+ paths); ~70% of
nodes are single-path or dead-ends, so the map was usually skipped. Now the
controller always renders it: interactive at forks (unchanged), and a "you are
here" view with a Continue button on single-path nodes and at sector starts
(`renderMap` no longer early-returns on no-choice; new `continueFromMap` advances
via the same `startNextGame` path). UI-only — verify the modal/button in a
browser. (2) BUG found while verifying: advancing into a boss node threw
`ReferenceError: getConstructedDeck is not defined` — `startNextGame` (run.js)
called the bare name, but it lives inside draft.js's DRAFT IIFE (every other site
uses `DRAFT.getConstructedDeck`). Slipped in at the v1.0.135 meta.js→run.js split;
fixed. The boss banner never worked before this (the crash preempted it). New
`test_map_progression.js` walks a full sector (root→boss→next sector) asserting no
throw + map state present every transition. 1111 green.

v2.0.29: bugfix — two faults behind "Patient Saint + High Priestess + Ajani's
Pridemate didn't chain." (1) `card_has_subtype(X)` guarded on
`Array.isArray(c.sub)`, but `sub` is a space-separated STRING everywhere (token
cards, splice merge, matchFilter), so every subtype-ETB trigger (High Priestess
"another Cleric entered → gain 2 life"; the subtype lords) silently never fired.
Now a word-boundary string match (triggers.js), matching matchFilter. (2)
`scope:'self'` creature effects were silently dropped: the pump/affect_creature/
grant_keyword handlers route any `params.scope` through `creaturesInScope()`,
which returns `[]` for `'self'` — so a self-pump applied to NOBODY (Ajani's
Pridemate + ~13 self-pump cards + the Skirmisher/Reaper stickers; also Char's "1
damage to you"). The four resolution paths already resolve `scope:'self'` into the
`target` arg, so `resolveEffectParams` now strips `scope:'self'` and the handler
operates on that target (engine.js). Neither bug crashed → tests/selfplay stayed
green (the §8.1 lockstep trap). New `test_scope_self_and_subtype.js` asserts the
observable effects (9 checks). 1105 green, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.28: dead-code prune — removed the unused `formatCost` helper (render.js).
The plain-concat mana formatter (`{R:2}`→`"RR"`) was fully superseded by
`formatCostBraced` (`"{R}{R}"`, the input to `renderManaSymbols`); it had zero
callers across js/ + tests/ + the HTML shell. A conservative whole-corpus
reference scan (raw `\bname\b` counts with strings INCLUDED, so `onclick=`
handler refs are counted — stripping them is what makes naive dead-code scans
lie) found it the only declared function appearing exactly once, confirming the
v2.0.11→v2.0.27 cleanup arc left the engine clean. Behavioral no-op; 1096 green.

v2.0.27: inlined the always-true FLASH_AI_ENABLED flag. With the A/B setter gone
(v2.0.26), the flag was a `const true` gating 4 `if (FLASH_AI_ENABLED && …)` sites
— an always-true condition is a dead abstraction, so the flag is removed and the
flash-AI heuristics (end-step tempo, ambush bonus, flash-hold deferral) now run
unconditionally, which is exactly what they always did. Per-site comments already
document the flash-AI intent, so no marker lost. Behavioral no-op; 1096 green,
300-game selfplay clean. (Should've done this in v2.0.26 instead of demoting
let→const — an always-true flag IS the cruft.)

v2.0.26: removed the dead flash-AI A/B setter/getter. `setFlashAIEnabled`/
`isFlashAIEnabled` had zero callers (confirmed across js/ + tests/) — deleted
them + their exports. Kept `FLASH_AI_ENABLED` (it's READ at 4 sites, so live) but
demoted `let`→`const` since nothing reassigns it now; flip the const for tuning
A/B. (Earlier I'd kept the setter/getter as a "deliberate seam" — wrong call; a
comment claiming usefulness isn't a caller. Confirmed-dead → removed.) 1096 green.

v2.0.25 (docs): re-corrected the #7 symmetricize status. v2.0.22 claimed #7 was
"NOT done (still monolithic)" — that was wrong, an over-correction from an audit
agent's surface read. Verified by reading the handler + doSymmetricizeChoice
against §3.8: symmetricize IS decomposed per spec — it stays a named effect with
a player-choice prompt (§3.8 explicitly specifies "the effect computes its value
via its player-choice prompt and calls the shared apply path") and emits
stat_boost + cost_mod snapshot stickers via the shared pipeline (no bespoke slot
field; applyBalancerOverrides/symmetrizedTo gone). No code change — the code was
already correct; only the doc status was wrong. (The "decompose symmetricize"
audit task resolved to: it's already done; nothing to build.)

v2.0.24: dedup (audit finding). Two extractions, both behavior-preserving:
(1) `makeSlotTargetGetter(targets)` replaces FOUR byte-identical lazy per-slot
target-getter closures (spell-resolve, resolveTopOfStack, trigger, ability — the
audit found 3; there were 4). Each was a Map + closure snapshotting the slot
target on first read (§3.6). (2) `validTargetsBySlot(card, targetedEffs, who)`
unifies the slot-grouping + per-slot spec resolution shared by `isLegalAction`
(cast-legality) and `getLegalActions` (AI enumeration) — the same logic whose
`slotSpecs ? : eff` comment had already drifted (fixed in v2.0.22), exactly the
kind of duplication this removes. isLegalAction now checks the given target
against the slot's resolved set; getLegalActions builds its cross-product from
the same Map. Equivalent (per-effect validation == per-slot intersection).
1096 green, 35 multi-target cast regressions pass, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.23: snake_case the dynamic-value DSL (audit #4 — the one Godot-facing miss).
The `{from:"..."}` computed-amount tokens were still camelCase (the #9 sweep did
keys only): `targetPower`→`target_power`, `targetToughness`→`target_toughness`,
`targetController`→`target_controller`, `sourcePower`→`source_power`,
`sourceToughness`→`source_toughness`, `countCreaturesYou`→`count_creatures_you`,
`countCreaturesOpp`→`count_creatures_opp`. Renamed the tokens in `resolveExpr`'s
switch (engine.js), the card-text `describeAmount` dynMap + the `who.from`
comparison (also fixed a pre-existing dynMap key bug: `targetTough` →
`target_toughness`, matching the real token), and the 2 cards that use them
(exorcist, swords). render.js's local `targetController` variable is NOT a token —
left alone. Not an active break (Godot doesn't read computed values yet), but
closes the latent wire-format trap before Godot ports those cards. 1096 green,
200-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.22: post-audit cleanups (4 verification agents). Dead-code prune + doc
corrections. Deleted: dead card-text `case 'embargo'`/`'bleach'` (cards decomposed,
no kind uses them); dead `triggerNeedsPlayerChoice` (superseded by
`triggerPlayerTargetPrompt`); dead export entries `allCardEffects`,
`affectOneCreature` (engine), `spellValue` (AI) — functions stay, only the unused
export tokens removed. KEPT `EFFECTS.steal` — the audit agents flagged it dead
("no card uses kind:steal") but `change_control` delegates to it at engine.js
for the `transfer_ownership` case (Steal card); verified live before NOT deleting.
Corrected the misleading per-effect-fallback comments (it serves MODAL charm
cards — which carry per-effect target in their modes — NOT staple-synthesis, which
the audit proved carries only card-level target). Fixed: stale version header
(was v2.0.2); `cards/cityGuardian` keyword typo `"first strike"`→`"first_strike"`;
ARCHITECTURE.md stale effect-dispatch list (removeCreature→affect_creature etc.).
Corrected a FALSE status claim: #7 symmetricize was marked "already done" but is
still a monolithic effect (decomposition pending — done next). 1096 green.

v2.0.21: review cleanup (#5b phase 3 — COMPLETE) — target_slots is the single
source of truth for the 5 multi-target spells. Dropped inline per-effect
`eff.target` from branchingBolt/twin_strike/drain_life/roots_and_branches/
swordAndSorcery; each slot-bound effect now carries only `target_slot:N`, and the
filter lives in the card-level `target_slots[N]` spec. Consumers migrated to read
the slot spec: `effectNeedsTarget` now recognizes slot-bound effects
(target_slot != null); getLegalActions + isLegalAction prefer
`card.target_slots[slot]` for per-slot validity/validation; card-text's
describeEffectList resolves the synthetic per-effect target from the slot spec
(extends the existing top-level-step mapping); render's slot machinery
(pendingObjectTargetSlots, slotsNeededForPending, pendingTargetEffect)
recognizes card-level target_slots, not just ability-level. New end-to-end cast
regressions in test_targeting_cast.js (cross-product enumeration; both targets
damaged; drainLife's mixed creature/player slots: creature dmg + opp life-loss +
self life-gain). 1096 green, 500-game selfplay clean. The per-effect-target shape
now survives ONLY as the staple-synthesis runtime fallback (a contained
`slotSpecs ? : eff` branch in the two enumeration sites) — staple-merged spells
are runtime synthesis, not authored wire format, and the canonical API handles
them. Fully migrating synthesizeStapledTemplate to emit target_slots (to delete
that fallback) is deferred: the staple/splice pipeline is complex and the value
(removing a one-line fallback) doesn't justify the regression risk.

v2.0.20: review cleanup (#5b phase 1/2) — canonical target_slots on multi-target
cards + kill the dead multi_target flag. The 5 multi-target spells (branchingBolt,
twinStrike, drainLife, rootsAndBranches, swordAndSorcery) now carry a card-level
`target_slots: [{target:...}, ...]` array (the same shape Stapler's abilities use)
and explicit `target_slot:0` on the first targeted effect. The `multi_target`
boolean was a DEAD WRITE — set in synthesizeStapledTemplate (engine.js:518/526)
and on the 5 cards, but READ nowhere (multi-target is recognized structurally via
per-effect target_slot in slotsNeededForPending + the canonical target API).
Removed all writes + the card-data flag. This phase is purely additive/dead-code:
inline per-effect `eff.target` is still present and still what card-text/AI/the
render slot-pick read; dropping it (so target_slots is the single source) is
phase 3, which must also teach render's slot machinery to read card-level
target_slots (today slotsNeededForPending only recognizes ability-level
target_slots, not card-level). 1083 green, 300-game selfplay clean.

v2.0.19: review cleanup (#5a) — self-direction `target:"self"` → `scope:"self"`.
Per-effect `target: "self"` was the legacy way of saying "this half of the spell
acts on the source/controller, not the picked target" — which conflated two
distinct concerns under the `target` field. Migrated to `scope: "self"` (the §3.5
canonical for self-direction): 44 cards (on-cast + triggers + activated abilities),
all 4 engine dispatch sites (spell resolver + trigger resolver + two more), all
card-text rendering sites (~10), 4 AI sites, trigger-generator's 5 template rolls
+ random-trigger card, the scarified-sticker payload (cards.js) + the 5 sticker
effects defined at the top of engine.js, and the 5 test files that constructed
synthetic effects with `target:"self"` inputs. Selfplay caught a real regression
mid-migration: the engine dispatch was sed-switched ahead of all the producers,
so triggers were briefly running `pump`/`gain_life` with null targets (152
crashes in 500 games). Completing the producer migration (especially the trigger/
ability effects in 44 cards — jq's first pass only walked on-cast effects) cleared
the regression. 1083 green, 500-game selfplay clean. This is **5a** — the
self-direction half of #5. The multi-target canonicalization (multi_target flag →
ability-level target_slots on the 5 multi-target spells) is **5b**, deferred: it
entangles with the staple-merge pipeline (engine.js:518/526 still sets
multi_target=true on staple), and that's not session-tail work.

v2.0.18: review cleanup (#9) — field-name snake_case sweep. Renamed 24 camelCase
JSON keys across the card pool to snake_case to match the rest of the wire
format: `customText`/`multiTarget`/`staticBuffs`/`permanentEot`/`staticCostBump`/
`triggerPoolSeed`/`chargesAtRunStart`/`buildOnDraw`/`artLadder`/`ripOnTarget`/
`targetSlot`/`targetSlots`/`tokenId`/`stickerId`/`grantHaste`/`notToken`/
`modeNames`/`hasKeyword`/`maxTough`/`notColor`/`spliceableBase`/`spliceableStaple`/
`minPT`/`sorcerySpeed` → snake_case equivalents (and the orphan filter-field
reads `notKeyword`/`minTough`/`maxPower`/`minPower` in consumer code, for
vocabulary consistency — no card uses them today). 63 card JSONs + ~12 JS modules
+ tests updated in one coordinated pass. Godot's `JsonCardLoader` doesn't read
these fields (Phase 6 unstarted), so no Godot churn — the renamed JSON arrives
already-snake_case when Godot starts porting these cards. 1083 green, 500-game
selfplay clean. (`targetSlotIdx` is a JS-internal variable name, not a wire-format
field — out of scope.)

v2.0.17: review cleanup (#8) — effect-shorthand parser (§5.1/§5.2). Card effects
may now be authored as function-call strings ("damage(3)", "draw(2)",
"chooses(creature)") that ingestCard() normalizes to canonical dicts at load
(triggers.js: `_parseEffectCall` + `desugarEffectString` + `normalizeCardEffects`,
reusing the predicate lexer). The §5.2 curated movement shorthands (draw/discard/
mill/bounce/search_for/search_land_tapped/shuffle_into_library/
target_player_discards) desugar to canonical move_card — verified executable
against the (already-generalized) move_card handler. `flicker` is intentionally
omitted: its §5.2 desugar needs a `previous_target` move_card selector the engine
doesn't implement. Dict-form effects pass through untouched, so the all-dict pool
is a no-op; no card uses shorthand yet (forward-authoring seam). New
test_effect_shorthand.js (25 checks incl. end-to-end execution). 1083 green.

v2.0.16: review cleanup (#6) — relocated AI spell valuation engine.js → ai.js.
Moved `spellValue` / `spellValueForEffects` + the `VALUED`/`UNVALUED` effect-kind
classification to ai.js module scope (exposed on `AI.*` for tests; the engine
coverage report reads the sets lazily, like the cast-scoring sets). KEPT the
engine-consumed creature-body heuristics (`getCardValue`, `sacValueOnBoard`,
`abilityValue`) in engine.js — `dealCombatDamage`'s blocker damage-assignment
order and the edict `chooses()` auto-pick genuinely depend on them, so a full
relocation would force a combat-behavior change (the engine has its own coarse
`cardValueOrZero` for layering-pure picks, but switching combat onto it is a
behavioral change, out of scope here). No behavioral change; 1058 green, 500-game
selfplay clean. (Engine internals live in the ENGINE IIFE — ai.js reaches the
two shared helpers via `ENGINE.sevToNum` / `ENGINE.getModes`; `TOKENS` is a
top-level global.)

v2.0.15: review cleanup (slice 4a/4) — broadened rip (plan #27/§13). Built the
zone-agnostic `rip` primitive (run-layer slot-strip reading ctx.chosen's
snapshotted slotIdx) and decomposed Vile Edict from the `rip_permanent` monolith →
`target(opp) → chooses(permanent) → annihilate → rip`. Per user call, KEPT the
"rip a permanent" breadth (generalized `chooses()` to honor a `permanent` filter,
not just creatures). Deleted `rip_permanent` + the now-dead `pendingRipSelect`
prompt machinery (engine + render + controller + AI). Note: rip-edict now uses
`annihilate` (no death triggers, matches §13) and auto-picks the victim's permanent
(human rip-pick prompt folds into the tracked GAP-2 human-chooses work, like
Diabolic Edict). Browser-verify the rip UI removal (DOM not covered by Node tests).
