# Magiclike — Godot port

Magic: The Gathering-style roguelike. The repo holds two things: the in-progress **Godot 4.6 port** (at the repo root) and the **html-proto** reference implementation it's being ported from (at `reference/html-proto/`). Both branches are under some degree of active development.

The html-proto is a vanilla-JS rules engine — ~20k+ LOC across 13 modules under `js/` plus per-card JSONs under `cards/<tplId>/`. 250+ card templates, full priority/stack model, triggered abilities, draft, roguelike meta. Active on the `dev` branch; see `reference/html-proto/CLAUDE.md` for the current version and module map.

The Godot port reimplements the engine natively. **Structurally similar, not 1:1** — the JS rendering layer doesn't translate, and several JS-specific patterns need rethinking (see "Patterns to NOT replicate" below). Current state: Phases 0–5c shipped (Lightning Bolt through real AI vs AI). 23 cards in `cards/templates/card_database.gd`, 10 phase smoke tests, AI plays complete games. Next: card pool expansion → stickers → draft → roguelike meta (see `docs/godot-port-plan.md` for the forward roadmap).

Deferred work lives in `docs/BACKLOG.md` — read it when relevant, but don't open a session by attacking it. The user picks what to work on; if you finish a task and have idle attention, surface 1–2 backlog items as suggestions rather than just starting the next one.

## Working branches & GitHub Pages

- **`dev`** — primary working branch for Godot-side work and the html-proto. PR to here.
- **`main`** — periodic forward-merge from `dev`.
- **GitHub Pages serves from `dev`**, pointing at `reference/html-proto/magiclike_engine.html`. Pushing to `dev` makes html-proto changes live for play-testing. Godot work doesn't affect Pages but shares the branch.

## Module layout

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `engine/engine.gd` | Autoload `RulesEngine`. State holder, `execute_action`, settle loop, `_fire_event`, `_drain_pending_triggers`, `_resolve_*_entry`, `_run_sbas`, two-pass combat damage, `get_legal_actions`. ~1840 lines. |
| `engine/engine_state.gd` | RefCounted state container: players, stack, attackers, blockers, `pending_triggers`, `awaiting_target_for_trigger`, `awaiting_block_declaration`, `duplicate_deep()`. |
| `engine/player.gd`, `mana_pool.gd`, `stack.gd`, `phase_machine.gd` | RefCounted state subclasses. Each has a `duplicate_deep()` for AI snapshots. |
| `engine/card_instance.gd` | Per-card runtime state — tapped, damage, summoning_sick, granted_keywords, lethal_marked. `effective_keywords()` unions template + grants + (future) stickers. |
| `engine/action.gd` | Action-descriptor factories: `make_cast_spell`, `make_play_land`, `make_pass_priority`, `make_pick_trigger_target`, `make_confirm_blocks`, etc. |
| `engine/ai/ai.gd` | `AI.decide(state, player_key) -> Dictionary`. Decision order: trigger target → block → attack → instant response → main → pass. |
| `engine/ai/combat.gd` | `decide_attackers`, `decide_blockers`, `simulate_combat` (uses `duplicate_deep`). |
| `engine/ai/burn.gd` | `face_damage_in_hand`, `has_lethal` — direct-damage lethal recognition. |
| `engine/ai/scoring.gd` | `AIScoring.card_value(template, purpose)` — heuristic card scoring (stats minus cost + keyword bonuses). |
| `engine/effects/effects.gd` | `HANDLERS` dispatch table. Per-kind handlers in sibling files. |
| `engine/predicates/predicates.gd` | String-keyed `cond_*` predicates with `evaluate(name, state, source, event)`. Boot-time `validate_all_card_predicates()` checks all `condition_predicate` strings against the registry. |
| `cards/templates/card_database.gd` | Programmatic `CardResource` definitions. Hand-authored; grow as new cards are added. |
| `scenes/game/game_board.gd` | UI orchestrator. Reads `RulesEngine.state()`, paints zones, manages target-pick / trigger-target / block-decl modes, keybinds. ~1275 lines. |
| `scenes/game/player_panel.gd` | Life total, mana pips, hand / library / graveyard counts, low-library warning glyph. |
| `scenes/game/combat_lines.gd` | Overlay drawing the attacker → blocker lines during COMBAT_BLOCK / COMBAT_DAMAGE. |
| `scenes/card.gd` | Card visual subclass — oracle text overlay, legality glow, combat highlight states. |
| `scenes/zones/battlefield_zone.gd` | Two-row layout (creatures full-width, lands cascaded). |

## Architecture decisions

- **`engine/engine.gd` as autoload `RulesEngine`.** Closest fit to the JS prototype's IIFE singleton. Globally accessible via `RulesEngine.state()`. Named `RulesEngine` and not `Engine` because Godot already has a built-in `Engine` global.
- **Logic in `RefCounted` classes**, not in the autoload itself. `Player`, `ManaPool`, `Stack`, `PhaseMachine`, `CardInstance`, `EngineState` are all RefCounted — instantiable in tests without autoload boilerplate.
- **Action descriptor pattern.** All state mutations go through `RulesEngine.execute_action(action: Dictionary)` where action is `{kind: "cast_spell" | "activate_ability" | "play_land" | "pass_priority" | ..., source, targets, ...}`. Mirrors the JS `executeAction`.
- **String-keyed trigger predicates with future-proof seams.** Card resources reference conditions by string name (`condition_predicate: "opp_lost_life_this_turn"`); the registry at `engine/predicates/predicates.gd` resolves the name to a function. Lets us swap predicate implementations or share them across cards without touching resource files.
- **Real stack and priority from day one.** The stack is a real LIFO that holds spells AND triggers. Both resolve through `_resolve_*_entry`. Priority follows MTG rules where it matters: caster retains priority after casting (117.1c), mana pools empty at phase boundaries (106.4), defender declares blocks before priority opens at COMBAT_BLOCK (509.1a), triggers drain in APNAP order (603.3b). Pragmatic shortcuts exist (AI auto-passes opp's priority; player has Space/Enter pass-priority keybind; SBAs are checked in a single sweep, not strict 704.5 order) — these are agent/UX concerns, not rules cheats. Config for explicit stop-on-X priority holds is parked in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.
- **Click-to-cast UI, not drag-to-cast.** Drag conflicts with card-framework's drag-to-move semantics. Click a spell in hand → enter target-picking mode → click a target → resolve.

## Patterns to NOT replicate from the prototype

The html-proto is the reference, but its rules engine has known scars from organic growth. When porting a feature, port the **behavior**, not the implementation shape. Specifically:

- **Don't reach into autoloads from inside predicates or effect handlers.** Predicates take `(state, source, event)` and return bool. Effects take `(ctx, params, target)` and resolve. No reading `RulesEngine.state()` from inside these — it breaks testability and matches the JS prototype's worst pattern (`G[them].lifeLostThisTurn` closures into global state).
- **Don't add depth caps to trigger draining.** The prototype has them as a safety net for past infinite-loop bugs. If our drain code is correct, it doesn't need a safety net.
- **Don't model per-instance mutable state as dynamically-attached dictionary fields.** Use typed properties on `CardInstance` / `Player`. The prototype's City of Brass `extraManaColors` lost on instantiation (see engine.js ~L2107 comment) is the cautionary tale; our `duplicate_deep()` overrides prevent that class of bug.
- **Auto-passes are agent UX, not rules.** The `_settle_state` loop auto-passes for the AI driver and for unattended priority windows. Don't conflate this with "priority is skipped" — the priority pass IS happening, the AI driver is just calling `execute_action(pass_priority)` automatically.

## Risks and gotchas

- **Predicates need explicit state access.** Pass full state as the first argument to every predicate (`func cond_x(state, source, event) -> bool`). Documented in `predicates.gd`'s header.
- **Stack as `Array[StackEntry]`, not as a `CardContainer`.** Triggered abilities go on the stack but aren't cards. The engine model is `Array[StackEntry]`; the UI is a plain VBoxContainer observing `RulesEngine.stack_changed`.
- **`@tool` annotation gotcha.** Existing `test.gd` is `@tool`-annotated, which triggers `_ready()` in the Godot editor. Game scenes must NOT be `@tool` — the editor will spam errors when the `RulesEngine` autoload isn't initialized.
- **Card-framework drag conflict.** Drag is reserved for "move card between containers." Casting a spell with targets is conceptually different. Stick with click-to-cast.
- **Predicate registry boot validation.** `engine.gd._ready()` walks all loaded `CardResource` instances, collects every `condition_predicate` string, and `push_error`s on any missing entry. Catches typos at startup, not at runtime.

## Testing

Each phase has a runnable scene at `tests/test_phaseN.{gd,tscn}` (e.g., `test_phase4_5a`, `test_phase5c`). Headless invocation:

```
"/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Godot Engine/godot.windows.opt.tools.64.exe" \
  --headless --path "C:/Users/Joe/Documents/magiclike" res://tests/test_phaseN.tscn
```

Each test prints assertion results and exits with code 0 (pass) / 1 (fail). Roughly 30 seconds per phase. A slice is "done" when its new test passes AND all prior phase tests still pass.

## Licenses & attributions

**Any time a new outside resource is added to the project — code library, asset pack, AI-art batch, font, sound, tool, anything — log it in `LICENSES.md` at the repo root.** That file is the canonical record of what we depend on, what license each dependency is under, and what we owe attribution-wise. Add the entry in the same commit that pulls the resource in.

Current entries (as of v1.0.180): chun92's Godot Card Framework (MIT), Godot Engine 4.6, pixellab AI art, Claude (this assistant), Almendra fantasy serif font (Google Fonts, SIL OFL 1.1), Claude-authored mana symbol SVGs. See `LICENSES.md` for the full list.

Shared assets (used by both the Godot port and the html-proto) live at `assets/` at repo root. Currently: `assets/fonts/Almendra/` and `assets/mana/` (WUBRG SVGs + design source). Html-proto-specific assets live at `reference/html-proto/assets/`.

## Git workflow

- Commit changes, but only push when explicitly asked.
- Don't open PRs unless asked.
- New work happens in a git worktree (see `~/.claude/worktrees/`). Parallel Claude sessions each need their own worktree — sharing one causes branch-switch clobbering.
- No version-bump rule for the Godot side (the binary isn't browser-served; Pages serves html-proto only).
